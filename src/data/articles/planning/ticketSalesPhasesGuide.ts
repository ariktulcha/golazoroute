        title: 'Why Understanding Ticket Sales Phases is Critical',
        content: `<p>Getting a ticket to the <strong>FIFA World Cup 2026™</strong> is fundamentally different from buying tickets to most sporting events. It's not a simple "add to cart" experience. Instead, <strong>FIFA releases tickets in distinct, strategically timed phases</strong> that span from now through 2026.</p>
        
<p>This phased approach exists because:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Massive global demand</strong> - Billions of fans worldwide want tickets to just 104 matches</li>
  <li><strong>Fairness across regions</strong> - FIFA prioritizes domestic fans (from USA, Mexico, Canada) during certain phases</li>
  <li><strong>Capacity management</strong> - Prevents website crashes and manages stadium capacity across 16 venues</li>
  <li><strong>Revenue optimization</strong> - Different phases allow dynamic pricing based on demand</li>
</ul>

<p>To maximize your chances of getting tickets, you need to understand not just the timeline, but <strong>what specific actions to take and when to take them</strong>. Missing key deadlines or misunderstanding a sales phase could mean losing your opportunity.</p>`

        id: 'fifa-id-section',
        title: 'Step 1: Create Your FIFA ID - The Foundation',
        content: `<p><strong>Before anything else, you must create a FIFA ID.</strong> This is your official, non-negotiable entry ticket into the entire ticketing system.</p>

<h3>What is a FIFA ID?</h3>
<p>A FIFA ID is a unique account managed by FIFA that serves as your official identity for all ticketing, correspondence, and purchasing. It links your personal information, registration history, and ticket purchases across all FIFA platforms.</p>

<h3>Who Needs a FIFA ID?</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Anyone age 18 or older</strong> wanting to purchase tickets</li>
  <li><strong>Account holders</strong> (parents/guardians can create IDs for minors aged 5-17 as dependents)</li>
  <li><strong>All applicants</strong> in any sales draw, even if just entering the lottery</li>
</ul>

<h3>How to Create Your FIFA ID</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Visit <strong>FIFA.com</strong> (the official website)</li>
  <li>Click on "Register" or "My Account"</li>
  <li>Provide your email, password, and personal information (full name, date of birth, address, country)</li>
  <li><strong>Verify your email</strong> - FIFA will send a confirmation link</li>
  <li>Complete your profile with any additional information FIFA requests</li>
</ol>

<h3>Critical Points About FIFA ID Registration</h3>
<ul>
  <li>⚠️ <strong>Register immediately</strong> - Many early-phase draws have already occurred; delaying costs you opportunities</li>
  <li>✅ <strong>Use your legal name</strong> - The name on your FIFA ID must match your ID/passport for stadium entry</li>
  <li>✅ <strong>Keep your information current</strong> - If you move or change email, update your FIFA ID right away</li>
  <li>✅ <strong>Save your FIFA ID number</strong> - You'll need it for all future ticket correspondence</li>
  <li>⚠️ <strong>One ID per person</strong> - Creating multiple accounts can result in disqualification</li>
</ul>`

        id: 'sales-phases',
        title: 'Step 2: Understanding the Three Major Ticket Sales Phases',
        content: `<p>FIFA divides ticket sales into three main phases, each with different rules, timings, and availability.</p>

<h3>Phase 1: Early/Partner Draws (Already In Progress)</h3>

<p><strong>Timing:</strong> Started in early 2025 and ongoing through 2025</p>

<p><strong>What It Is:</strong> Early opportunity draws, often involving FIFA partners like Visa, or priority windows for specific groups (season ticket holders, specific national federations, hospitality partners).</p>

<p><strong>How It Works:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Eligible fans register for these draws</li>
  <li>Winners are randomly selected</li>
  <li>Selected winners receive a specific time window (often 48-72 hours) to purchase available tickets</li>
  <li>They can choose from remaining inventory during their window</li>
  <li>If they don't purchase in time, their slot passes to the next winner</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Who Gets Priority:</strong> Varies by draw - may include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Visa cardholders (Visa Presale)</li>
  <li>Season ticket holders from host country clubs</li>
  <li>Previous World Cup ticket purchasers</li>
  <li>Official tourism/hospitality partners</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> If you were eligible for Phase 1 draws and didn't participate, you've already missed some opportunities. Focus now on Phase 2.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Phase 2: Post-Draw Random Selection Draw (THE MAIN EVENT)</h3>

<p><strong>Timing:</strong> Starts shortly after December 5, 2025 (when the official tournament draw happens)</p>

<p><strong>What It Is:</strong> This is <strong>the primary and most significant ticket sales phase</strong>. The majority of tickets available to the general public are allocated during this phase.</p>

<p><strong>Why This Phase Matters:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Happens <strong>after the tournament draw</strong>, so you know which teams play which matches</li>
  <li><strong>Largest ticket allocation</strong> for general public</li>
  <li>Your best chance to get tickets for specific matches or teams</li>
  <li>Runs through 2025 and into 2026</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>How the Post-Draw Random Selection Works:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Decide what tickets you want:</strong> Choose between Single Match Tickets (SMT), Team-Specific Tickets (TST), or Venue-Specific Tickets (VST) - detailed in the next section</li>
  <li><strong>Submit your application:</strong> During the application window, you apply for your chosen ticket type and match(es)</li>
  <li><strong>FIFA runs the draw:</strong> A computer randomly selects applications from the pool</li>
  <li><strong>You get notified:</strong> If selected, FIFA emails you with a purchase code and a specific time window (typically 72 hours)</li>
  <li><strong>Purchase within your window:</strong> You log into FIFA.com/tickets and complete your purchase</li>
  <li><strong>Tickets delivered:</strong> Your tickets are added to your FIFA World Cup 26™ app account</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Multiple Application Windows:</strong> FIFA opens application windows multiple times throughout 2025 and 2026, so you get <strong>multiple chances</strong> to win the lottery.</p>

<p><strong>Estimated Timeline for Phase 2:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>December 2025: First applications open (specific dates TBA)</li>
  <li>January - February 2026: Subsequent application windows and draws</li>
  <li>March - May 2026: Final application windows as tournament approaches</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h3>Phase 3: Last-Minute Sales - First-Come, First-Served</h3>

<p><strong>Timing:</strong> Late 2025 through June 2026 (closer to tournament)</p>

<p><strong>What It Is:</strong> Final opportunity to purchase any remaining unsold tickets without entering a draw. Tickets sold instantly on a first-come, first-served basis.</p>

<p><strong>How It Works:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>No application period - tickets appear on FIFA.com/tickets when available</li>
  <li>You purchase immediately (no time window)</li>
  <li>Typically happens as the tournament gets closer</li>
  <li>Availability is unpredictable - matches with lower demand may have more tickets</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Why Last-Minute Sales Exist:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Some matches have lower initial demand</li>
  <li>Some regions' teams may be eliminated, freeing up their fans' purchased tickets</li>
  <li>Group stage matches in smaller markets may have unsold inventory</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Challenge:</strong> Website crashes are common when tickets drop. You need to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Monitor FIFA.com/tickets constantly</li>
  <li>Have your payment information pre-saved</li>
  <li>Be ready to check out instantly</li>
  <li>Tickets may sell out in seconds</li>
</ul>`

      {
        id: 'host-country-priority',
        title: 'Host Country Priority: Exclusive Advantage for US, Mexico & Canada Residents',
        content: `<p>One of the most important features of FIFA World Cup 2026 ticketing is <strong>priority access for residents of the three host nations: United States, Mexico, and Canada.</strong></p>

<h3>The Domestic Exclusivity Window</h3>

<p>During specific phases, FIFA opens <strong>exclusive application windows where only residents of a host nation can apply for tickets to matches in their home country.</strong></p>

<p><strong>How It Works:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>🇺🇸 <strong>US residents</strong> get priority access to apply for matches taking place in USA stadiums</li>
  <li>🇲🇽 <strong>Mexico residents</strong> get priority access to apply for matches taking place in Mexico stadiums</li>
  <li>🇨🇦 <strong>Canada residents</strong> get priority access to apply for matches taking place in Canada stadiums</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>During these exclusive windows:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>✅ You CAN apply for matches in your home country</li>
  <li>❌ You CANNOT apply for matches in the other two host countries</li>
  <li>⚠️ Non-residents cannot compete (window is closed to them)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Why This Matters:</strong> This gives domestic fans a major advantage. Without this exclusivity, international fans could buy up the best seats to matches in other host countries, reducing local attendance.</p>

<h3>How to Verify Your Residency</h3>

<p>FIFA uses official residency data to verify your eligibility for domestic windows. When you register for a draw, FIFA may ask for proof such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Copy of your government-issued ID (driver's license, passport)</li>
  <li>Proof of address (utility bill, lease agreement)</li>
  <li>Tax return or official government document</li>
</ul>

<p>📍 <strong>Important:</strong> If you're a resident but your FIFA ID has an outdated address, update it before applying.</p>

<h3>Timeline for Domestic Priority Windows</h3>

<p>Expected phases (specific dates to be announced by FIFA):</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>October - November 2025:</strong> First domestic priority window opens for host country residents</li>
  <li><strong>December 2025 - February 2026:</strong> Potential additional windows for later-stage matches</li>
  <li><strong>February - May 2026:</strong> Final opportunities for remaining tickets</li>
</ul>`

      {
        id: 'ticket-types',
        title: 'Step 3: Choosing Your Ticket Type - SMT vs. TST vs. VST',
        content: `<p>When you enter a sales draw or apply for tickets, you must decide <strong>which type of ticket package you want.</strong> Each has different benefits, prices, and flexibility. Understanding the differences is crucial.</p>

<h3>1. Single Match Tickets (SMT)</h3>

<p><strong>What You Get:</strong> One ticket to one specific match of your choice</p>

<p><strong>Best For:</strong> Flexible travelers, fans without a favorite team, people wanting to see specific opponents or matchups</p>

<p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>✅ Maximum flexibility - choose any match you want</li>
  <li>✅ Lower commitment - one match vs. a package</li>
  <li>✅ Can mix and match with other ticket types</li>
  <li>✅ Easier to find travel companions for one match</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>❌ Higher per-ticket prices than team packages</li>
  <li>❌ No guaranteed access to knockout stages</li>
  <li>❌ May face more competition in lottery (popular matches)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Price Range:</strong> Starts at $60 for cheapest seats in group stage; can exceed $1,000 for final matches</p>

<hr />

<h3>2. Team-Specific Tickets (TST)</h3>

<p><strong>What You Get:</strong> All three Group Stage matches for ONE national team, PLUS a guaranteed purchase option for knockout matches if that team advances</p>

<p><strong>Best For:</strong> Die-hard fans of a specific national team, fans traveling from that country, committed World Cup attendees</p>

<p><strong>How It Works:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>You select your favorite national team (e.g., Brazil, France, Argentina, USA, Mexico, Canada, etc.)</li>
  <li>If your application wins the draw, you receive tickets for ALL THREE group stage matches that team plays</li>
  <li>If your team advances to knockout stages, you get the <strong>right to purchase</strong> (not guaranteed free tickets) tickets for their knockout matches</li>
  <li>This continues through the quarterfinals, semifinals, and potentially the final</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>✅ Often cheaper per-ticket cost than single match tickets</li>
  <li>✅ Guaranteed entry to three group stage matches</li>
  <li>✅ First purchase right to knockout matches if team advances</li>
  <li>✅ Built-in travel plan (all matches in one city usually)</li>
  <li>✅ Great for team supporters and families traveling together</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>❌ Limited flexibility - committed to one team</li>
  <li>❌ If your team is eliminated early, you only have 3 matches</li>
  <li>❌ Can't cherry-pick specific high-demand matches</li>
  <li>❌ Travel must align with your team's schedule</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Price Range:</strong> Typically $300-$1,200 total for three group stage matches (varies by category and team popularity)</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong> USA fans buying USA TST would get tickets to all three USMNT group stage matches (likely in different cities), with purchase options for knockout stages if USMNT advances.</p>

<hr />

<h3>3. Venue-Specific Tickets (VST)</h3>

<p><strong>What You Get:</strong> Package of 4-9 matches at ONE specific stadium/host city (your choice)</p>

<p><strong>Best For:</strong> Fans who want to "World Cup tour" one city, families staying in one location, fans who want to see multiple teams play</p>

<p><strong>How It Works:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>You select your preferred host city (e.g., Los Angeles, Mexico City, Toronto, etc.)</li>
  <li>You receive a package of matches scheduled at that city's stadium</li>
  <li>You see 4-9 different matches, potentially 4-9 different teams</li>
  <li>You stay in one city for your entire World Cup experience</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>✅ See multiple matches without relocating</li>
  <li>✅ Get to know one host city deeply</li>
  <li>✅ Convenient travel and accommodation</li>
  <li>✅ Often good value per match</li>
  <li>✅ Great for families (kids don't want to move hotels)</li>
  <li>✅ See diverse teams and styles of play</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>❌ Can't choose specific matches - you get the venue's slate</li>
  <li>❌ Some major matches (like finals) excluded from VST in their city</li>
  <li>❌ Less flexibility if your favorite team isn't in that city</li>
  <li>❌ May include matches you're less interested in</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Price Range:</strong> Typically $800-$3,000+ for a package of 4-9 matches (varies by category, city, and match importance)</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong> Los Angeles VST might include 7 matches at SoFi Stadium during group stage and knockout rounds, seeing teams from multiple countries.</p>

<h3>Which Ticket Type Should You Choose?</h3>

<p><strong>Choose SMT if:</strong> You're flexible, want to see specific matches or opponents, or are going solo</p>

<p><strong>Choose TST if:</strong> You're a passionate fan of a specific country, want the best value, or are traveling with family supporters</p>

<p><strong>Choose VST if:</strong> You want to stay in one city, prefer convenience, or want a "World Cup tour" experience</p>`

        title: '⚠️ CRITICAL WARNING: Use Only Official Channels',
        content: `<p><strong>This cannot be overstated:</strong> FIFA World Cup 2026 tickets purchased from <strong>anywhere except the official FIFA channels</strong> may be fake, invalid, or cancelled.</p>

<h3>The Official FIFA Ticketing Channels</h3>

<p>✅ <strong>FIFA.com/tickets</strong> - Primary official platform</p>

<p>✅ <strong>FIFA.com/hospitality</strong> - Official hospitality packages (premium)</p>

<p>❌ StubHub</p>

<p>❌ Ticketmaster (in this case - different for other events)</p>

<p>❌ Unofficial resellers</p>

<p>❌ Social media offers</p>

<p>❌ Broker websites</p>

<p>❌ Tour operators (unless they're official FIFA partners with direct FIFA authorization)</p>

<h3>Why Counterfeit and Invalid Tickets Are Rampant</h3>

<p>The FIFA World Cup is so high-demand that criminals profit from:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Creating completely fake digital tickets</li>
  <li>Selling the same ticket to multiple people</li>
  <li>Selling stolen tickets from legitimate purchases</li>
  <li>Charging massive markups for forged admission</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Result:</strong> You arrive at the stadium with a worthless ticket, miss the match, and lose all your money.</p>

<h3>How to Verify Legitimate Tickets</h3>

<ul>
  <li>✅ Tickets are delivered via the official <strong>FIFA World Cup 26™ App</strong></li>
  <li>✅ You receive official FIFA email confirmation from <strong>tickets@fifa.com</strong></li>
  <li>✅ Your ticket has FIFA's security features and hologram elements (if physical)</li>
  <li>✅ You can log into FIFA.com/tickets and see your tickets in your account</li>
</ul>

<h3>If You're Considering Resale</h3>

<p>FIFA does allow official ticket resale, but <strong>only through the official FIFA platform</strong>. More on this in the dedicated resale guide.</p>`

It\'s required because FIFA uses it to verify your identity, track eligibility for different sales phases (especially domestic vs. international), manage draws fairly, and communicate with you about selections. Without a FIFA ID, you cannot enter any ticket drawing, purchase tickets, or receive notifications.'
      },
      {
        question: 'If I register for a draw but don\'t win, do I have to pay anything?',
        answer: 'No. Entering a draw is completely free. You only pay if your application wins the lottery and you choose to purchase tickets during your purchase window. There are no entry fees, registration fees, or penalties for losing the draw.'
      },
      {
        question: 'How many times can I apply for tickets?',
        answer: 'You can apply multiple times across different application windows and for different ticket types. FIFA opens numerous application windows from December 2025 through May 2026. You can submit separate applications for SMT, TST, and VST in different windows, increasing your chances of winning at least one drawing.'
      },
      {
        question: 'I\'m a US resident. Do I have an advantage over international fans?',
        answer: 'Yes, during domestic exclusivity windows. The USA, Mexico, and Canada residents each get exclusive application periods to purchase tickets for matches in their home country. During these windows, only US residents can apply for US matches, giving you priority access. Outside these windows, you compete with international fans. This is by FIFA\'s design to ensure strong domestic attendance.'
      },
      {
        question: 'If my team gets eliminated in the group stage and I bought TST, do I get a refund?',
        answer: 'No, unfortunately not. If you purchase a Team-Specific Ticket package and your team is eliminated early, you still own tickets to those three group stage matches and keep them. The ticket price is for the group stage matches themselves, not for access to later stages. However, if your team advances, you get the purchase option (not free) for knockout matches.'
      },
      {
        question: 'How do I know if I\'ve won a ticket draw?',
        answer: 'FIFA notifies winners via email sent to the email address registered with your FIFA ID. They email from tickets@fifa.com with the subject line clearly indicating you\'ve been selected. If you don\'t receive an email, you didn\'t win that draw. Make sure you add FIFA tickets emails to your contacts so they don\'t go to spam. Winners receive a purchase code and a specific time window (usually 72 hours) to purchase.'
      },
      {
        question: 'What happens if I win the draw but don\'t purchase during my 72-hour window?',
        answer: 'Your purchase opportunity expires and your tickets go to the next person on the waitlist. You do not get another chance during that draw phase, though you can apply again in future application windows. It\'s critical to stay alert during your purchase window - set phone reminders and ensure you can access your computer/credit card.'
      },
      {
        question: 'Are tickets actually limited or is FIFA creating artificial scarcity?',
        answer: 'FIFA has legitimate capacity constraints - each stadium has a specific number of seats. With 104 matches across 16 stadiums and billions of potential fans worldwide, genuine scarcity exists. However, FIFA also manages demand through their phased release strategy to prevent website crashes and ensure orderly distribution. Some matches (especially finals and semi-finals) have significantly fewer available seats than others.'
      },
      {
        question: 'Can my friend and I apply for the same tickets together in one application?',
        answer: 'Each person must apply individually for tickets. Your friend needs their own FIFA ID and submits their own application. If you both win separate drawings, you each get your own tickets. You cannot submit a group application or request adjacent seats during the application phase, though FIFA may provide seat selection options during checkout depending on how many tickets you\'re purchasing.'
      },
      {
        question: 'If I live outside the USA, Mexico, or Canada, am I shut out of buying tickets?',
        answer: 'No. International fans can purchase tickets during the non-exclusive application windows when FIFA opens applications to all countries. These global application rounds typically happen alongside or between the domestic exclusivity windows. You just won\'t have the advantage of priority windows that domestic fans enjoy. You compete in the same random draw as everyone else during global application phases.'
      }
